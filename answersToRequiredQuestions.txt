could work on it in the future?
- If I had more time for this product I would connect it to Google OAth, QuickBooks, SalesForce, etc..  so users could upload their 
files directly from their preferred platform.

llm questions about their data and get answers in real time. 
- Additionally, I would want to optomize all components and only render necessary components on the client
everything else would be rendered on the server for efficiency
